Waits until text appears on current page.

Fails if timeout expires before the element appears.

Example:
| Wait Till Element Contains Text | css=#id | new text |
| Wait Till Element Contains Text | css=#id | new text | 200 | 20000 |

=>

| Wait for the element to contains text 'new text', timeout is the configured implicit wait.
| Wait for the element to contains text 'new text', polling every 200 milliseconds, and timeout of 20 seconds.
