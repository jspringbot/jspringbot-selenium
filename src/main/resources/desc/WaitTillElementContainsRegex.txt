Waits until element contains regex on current page.

Fails if timeout expires before the element appears.

Example:
| Wait Till Element Contains Regex | css=#id | [0-9]+ |
| Wait Till Element Contains Regex | css=#id | [0-9]+ | 200 | 20000 |

=>

| Wait for the element to matches text that contains numbers, timeout is the configured implicit wait.
| Wait for the element to matches text that contains numbers, polling every 200 milliseconds, and timeout of 20 seconds.
