Assigns a temporary identifier to element specified by locator.

This is mainly useful if the locator is complicated/slow XPath expression. Identifier expires when the page is reloaded.

*Example:*
| Assign ID to Element        | xpath=//div[@id="first_div"] | my id |
| Page Should Contain Element | my id | |
