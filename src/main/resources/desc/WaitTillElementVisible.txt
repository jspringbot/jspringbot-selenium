Waits until element specified with locator is visible on current page.

Fails if timeout expires before the element is visible.

Example:
| Wait Till Element Visible | css=#id |
| Wait Till Element Visible | css=#id | 200 | 20000 |

=>

| Wait for the element for visible, timeout is the configured implicit wait.
| Wait for the element for visible, polling every 200 milliseconds, and timeout of 20 seconds.
