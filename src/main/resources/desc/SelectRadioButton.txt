Sets selection of radio button group identified by group_name to value.

The radio button to be selected is located by two arguments:

    group_name is used as the name of the radio input
    value is used for the value attribute or for the id attribute

The XPath used to locate the correct radio button then looks like this: //input[@type='radio' and @name='group_name' and (@value='value' or @id='value')]

*Examples:*
| Select Radio Button | size | XL | # Matches HTML like <input type="radio" name="size" value="XL">XL</input> |
| Select Radio Button | size | sizeXL | # Matches HTML like <input type="radio" name="size" value="XL" id="sizeXL">XL</input> |
