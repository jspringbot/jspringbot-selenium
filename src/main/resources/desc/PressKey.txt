Simulates user pressing key on element identified by locator.

key is either a single character, or a numerical ASCII code of the key lead by '\'.

*Examples:*
| `Press Key` | text_field | q |
| `Press Key` | login_button | \\\\13 | # ASCII code for enter key |
| `Press Key` | id=passwd | \\\\9 | # ASCII code for tab key |

Sometimes this keyword does not trigger the correct JavaScript event on the clicked element. In those cases Press Key Native can be used as a workaround.

The selenium command key_press [1] that this keyword used exposes some erratic behavior [2], especially when used with the Internet Explorer. If you do not get the expected results, try Press Key Native instead.
