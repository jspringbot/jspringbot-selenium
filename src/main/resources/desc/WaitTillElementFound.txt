Waits until element specified with locator appears on current page.

Fails if timeout expires before the element appears.

Example:
| Wait Till Element Found | css=#id |
| Wait Till Element Found | css=#id | 200 | 20000 |

=>

| Wait for the element for found, timeout is the configured implicit wait.
| Wait for the element for found, polling every 200 milliseconds, and timeout of 20 seconds.
